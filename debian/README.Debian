pyparted (3.11.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

 Bug #887170.
 e2fsck name is referred in a docstring. pyparted does not
 need the e2fsprogs package to run.

 But some tools from e2fsprogs are used in test files in
 tests directory.

 If you want to run tests you will need the e2fsprogs package
 installed.
